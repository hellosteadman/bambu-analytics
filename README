Bambu Analytics
===============

Provides a simple, pluggable system for analytics

About Bambu Analytics
---------------------

Bambu Analytics provides a simple system for implementing analytics
tools like Google Analytics into your Django projects, so you can track
page views, goals and events.

By default it supports Google's `Universal
Analytics <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2790010?hl=en-GB>`_
programme, but you interact with the package within JavaScript via the
``bambu.analytics`` namespace. This way, you can change analytics
providers (or write your own) without changing the code within the rest
of your site.

This is massively a work-in-progress.

About Bambu Tools 2.0
---------------------

This is part of a toolset called Bambu Tools. It's being moved from a
namespace of ``bambu`` to its own 'root-level' package, along with all
the other tools in the set. If you're upgrading from a version prior to
2.0, please make sure to update your code to use ``bambu_analytics``
rather than ``bambu.analytics``.

Installation
------------

Install the package via Pip:

::

    pip install bambu-analytics

Add it to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list:

::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'bambu_analytics'
    )

Next, install the tracking middleware:

::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'bambu_analytics.middleware.AnalyticsMiddleware',
        ...
    )

Finally, set your Google Analytics ID:

::

    ANALYTICS_SETTINGS = {
        'UniversalAnalyticsProvider': {
            'ID': 'UA-XXXXXXXX-XX'
        }
    }

Or, use the shortcut setting:

::

    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_IDS = ('UA-XXXXXXXX-XX',)

(This is a legacy setting that will be deprecated in a future release)

Usage
-----

By default, all page views will be tracked once you include the
``tracking`` template tag in your base HTML template, like so:

::

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        ...
        <body>
            ...
            {% load analytics %}{% tracking %}
        </body>
    </html>

Tracking events are gathered by the middleware, as it allows trackable
events to be defined server-side. For example, when you submit an
enquiry form, you can add an event that will be tracked once the user is
redirected to the 'thank you' page.

The workflow
------------

1. The user requests a URL
2. The analytics middleware adds a page-view event to its tracking list
3. The view for that URL is rendered, and the script containing the
   analytics setup code and the tracked event from step 2 is rendered
4. The user submits a form on the page
5. The view for that form calls ``bambu_analytics.track_event``
6. An HTTP redirect is issued
7. The middleware reads the redirect and stores the tracking event in a
   session variable
8. The user's browser is redirected to a 'thank you' page
9. When the 'thank you' page is rendered, the tracking event stored in
   the session variable are read into JavaScript and rendered

All of this sounds complex, but actually means you can track events more
easily and in a pluggable, product-agnostic way. It also provides the
option for server-side analytics events to be tracked.

In Google Analytics, the practical upshot is that it uses events rather
than goals, meaning you don't have to manually define them in your
Analytics property.

Tracking an event
-----------------

Let's say you have a contact form. In the view that receives the form
data, you want to track the successful submission of form data and then
redirect the user to a page thanking them for getting in touch.

::

    from bambu_analytics import track_event, events

    def enquiry_form(request):
        # Handle submission of form data

        track_event(request, events.EVENT,
            category = u'Enquiry',
            action = u'Submit'
        )

Here, ``events.EVENT`` is a constant meaning 'a standard event'.

If you're using a client-side analytics library (like Google Analytics),
you should only track events in this way if you're going to redirect the
user back to a page that will load and render the ``tracking`` template
tag. Otherwise the event will be stored in the user's session cookie,
but won't be tracked by your provider.

If you're using a server-side provider - or you've written one, a:
please let me know! but b: - this method should work fine.

Trackable events
----------------

There are four types of trackable event within Bambu Analytics, but not
all of them are setup to work with Google's Universal Analytics just
yet.

-  ``events.PAGE``: a page view (this is handled automatically by
   middleware)
-  ``events.EVENT``: something of note happening on the site, that you
   want to measure
-  ``events.TRANSACTION``: a monetary transaction
-  ``events.TRANSACTION_ITEM``: part of an order (an item in someone's
   shopping cart)

The last two haven't been properly hooked up to Google's new system, but
you can use the legacy provider (see below).

Changing analytics provider
---------------------------

Bambu Analytics supports the legacy (ua.js) and new (analytics.js)
scripts as provided by Google. ecommerce is setup to work with the old
style (ua.js), so if you need to track ecommerce events, you should
change the provider via your Django settings file:

::

    ANALYTICS_PROVIDER = 'bambu_analytics.providers.google.GoogleAnalyticsProvider'

Writing your own provider
-------------------------

It's pretty easy to write your own provider. Start by taking a look at
the two classes in ``bambu_analytics.providers.google`` to see how
they're hooked up.

Essentially the job of a provider is to take Python objects that refer
to events and turn them into JavaScript objects and function calls that
your analytics library can understand.

Each provider needs to render a string. For client-side analytics tools
this should contain HTML with a ``<script>`` tag. The first thing inside
that tag should be:

::

    {% include 'analytics/bambu.inc.js' %}

This exposes the ``bambu.analytics`` namespace. After all the code
needed to hook up the analytics tool and track basic events, your
provider should bind to the ``track`` event within ``bambu.analytics``
like this:

::

    bambu.analytics.on('track',
        function(e) {
            // e.event contains the name of the event, which you can compare
            // against the constants in the bambu.analytics namespace (they're)
            // the same as the ones within the Python package.

            // e.args contains a dictionary of arguments that you can use to map
            // the Python-defined keyword args (like 'category' or 'option_value')
            // to arguments that your specific analytics library understands. See
            // the templates/analytics/universal.inc.html file for an idea of
            // how this works.
        }
    );

This way you can write an analytics provider that works on all sites
that use Bambu Analytics. Both of them!

Writing a server-side provider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to track your own events or you have a server-side analytics
tool that you want to hook into, you'll write a provider that focuses on
teh back- rather than front-end. You'll still need to render something,
but this can be an empty string, or some sort of tracking pixel if
that's the route you want to go down.

AJAX and client-side tracking
-----------------------------

If you want to track events client-side, or you're running a site that
uses a lot of AJAX (like `Poddle.fm <http://poddle.fm/>`_), you'll get
automatic access to the ``bambu.analytics`` namespace within JavaScript,
and you can call ``track()`` to handle client-side events or AJAX page
updates (ie: via ``window.pushstate``).

Here's an example event used on Poddle.fm when a user clicks the Play
button on an episode of a podcast:

::

    <script>
        $('a.btn-play').on('click',
            function() {
                // Play the audio
                ...

                // Track the click event
                bambu.analytics.track(
                    bambu.analytics.EVENT,
                    {
                        category: 'Audio',
                        action: 'play'
                    }
                );
            }
        );
    </script>
